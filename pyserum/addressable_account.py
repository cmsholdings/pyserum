# # ğŸ¥­ AddressableAccount class
#
# Some of our most-used objects (like `Group` or `MarginAccount`) are accounts on Solana
# with packed data. When these are loaded, they're typically loaded by loading the
# `AccountInfo` and parsing it in an object-specific way.
#
# It's sometimes useful to be able to treat these in a common fashion so we use
# `AddressableAccount` as a way of sharing common features and providing a common base.
